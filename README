The purpose of the DragonID Improved Child Health Record and Casing is 
to meet a need identified by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation: the great disparity 
in quality, durability, and consistency in current health record modalities around the world. 
Even in America, health records vary from hospital to hospital, and in much of the world they 
remain unintuitive, easy to misread, and even easier to accidentally damage and destroy. 
These design flaws are a major contributor to the international undervaccination of infants 
and young children, among other similar hindrances to the timely and proper administration 
of healthcare.

The DragonID team believes that our design solves all of these flaws. 
Our design strategy was focused on two areas: durability and ease of use. By utilizing an 
extremely portable case and extra-durable paper, the chance of accidental damage is greatly 
diminished. By hard-coding the Unique Identification Number to the paper itself, 
digitization and replacement of information becomes trivial, and by using an intuitive and simple 
layout, the chance of human error in terms of reading or writing the document is greatly 
diminished.

That said, there is only so much one team can account for with limited 
resources and a tight release deadline. For this reason, we are releasing our work to the 
public under the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

We invite you to do with it as you like: 3d-print the case, break it, 
report your results. Take the document layout, twist it, reshape it, make it better, publish your 
findings. Everything you need, all the work we've done, is at your disposal.
