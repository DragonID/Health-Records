Shaker Heights, OH – DragonID, LLC, the award-winning, Ohio-based healthcare innovation and design firm, announced today the open source release of their submission to the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation’s “Records for Life” contest. 
The release, under the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License, includes a digital copy of the record design, schematics for 3D-printing the casing prototype, and a narrative detailing production and deployment possibilities.

The company believes that making their entry available to the public will encourage continued development and improvement from interested developers and designers. 
DragonID, LLC also hope to raise awareness for the issue that the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation’s “Records for Life” contest was launched to solve: a lack of high quality, high durability, and easily accessible child health and immunization records in developing nations.

“Our company vision is to improve the lives and medical outcomes for patients across the world,” says Eugene Malinskiy, CEO of DragonID, LLC. “This design takes big steps toward that direction, but there’s always more that can be done with fresh insight.”
